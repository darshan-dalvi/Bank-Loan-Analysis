Problem Statement:

- In order to gain a comprehensive overview of our lending operations and
monitor the performance of loans, we aim to create a grid view report
categorized by Loan Status.

- By providing insights into metrics such as
	o Total Loan Applications
	o Total Funded Amount
	o Total Amount Received
	o Month-to-Date (MTD) Funded Amount
	o MTD Amount Received
	o Average Interest Rate
	o Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)

- This Analytics Report will empower us to make data-driven decisions
and assess the health of our loan portfolio.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements:

1. Total Loan Applications:
- We need to calculate the total number of loan applications received during a
specified period. Additionally, it is essential to monitor the Month-to-Date
(MTD) Loan Applications and track changes Month-over-Month (MoM).

2. Total Funded Amount:
- Understanding the total amount of funds disbursed as loans is crucial. We
also want to keep an eye on the MTD Total Funded Amount and analyse the
Month-over-Month (MoM) changes in this metric.

3. Total Amount Received:
- Tracking the total amount received from borrowers is essential for assessing
the bank's cash flow and loan repayment. We should analyse the Month-to-
Date (MTD) Total Amount Received and observe the Month-over-Month
(MoM) changes.

4. Average Interest Rate:
- Calculating the average interest rate across all loans, MTD, and monitoring
the Month-over-Month (MoM) variations in interest rates will provide
insights into our lending portfolio's overall cost.

5. Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):
- Evaluating the average DTI for our borrowers helps us gauge their financial
health. We need to compute the average DTI for all loans, MTD, and track
Month-over-Month (MoM) fluctuations.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Good Loans:

	1. Good Loan Application Percentage
	2. Good Loan Applications
	3. Good Loan Funded Amount
	4. Good Loan Total Received Amount

Bad Loans:

	5. Bad Loan Application Percentage
	6. Bad Loan Applications
	7. Bad Loan Funded Amount
	8. Bad Loan Total Received Amount

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chart's Requirement:

1. Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart):
To identify seasonality and long-term trends in lending activities

2. Regional Analysis by State :
To identify regions with significant lending activity and assess regional
disparities

3. Loan Term Analysis :
To allow the client to understand the distribution of loans across various term
lengths.

4. Employee Length Analysis:
How lending metrics are distributed among borrowers with different
employment lengths, helping us assess the impact of employment history on
loan applications.

5. Loan Purpose Breakdown:
Will provide a visual breakdown of loan metrics based on the stated purposes
of loans, aiding in the understanding of the primary reasons borrowers seek
financing.

6. Home Ownership Analysis :
For a hierarchical view of how home ownership impacts loan applications and
disbursements.
