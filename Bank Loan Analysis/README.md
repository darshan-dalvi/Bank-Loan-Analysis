# Bank Loan Analysis - Power BI

## Problem Statement
To monitor and assess the performance of our lending operations, this project aims to create a **grid view report** categorized by **Loan Status**, offering insights into critical metrics. The report will track:

- Total Loan Applications
- Total Funded Amount
- Total Amount Received
- Month-to-Date (MTD) Funded Amount
- MTD Amount Received
- Average Interest Rate
- Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)

This comprehensive analysis will provide actionable insights to help make data-driven decisions and evaluate the health of the loan portfolio.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### 1. Total Loan Applications:
- **Total Count**: Total loan applications received during a given period.

- **MTD Funded Amount**: Month-to-Date funded amount.
- **MoM Analysis**: Track MoM changes in the funded amount.

### 3. Total Amount Received:
- **Total Received**: Total payments received from borrowers.
- **MTD Received**: Month-to-Date received amount.
- **MoM Analysis**: Track MoM changes in received payments.

### 4. Average Interest Rate:
- **Average Rate**: Average interest rate across all loans.
- **MTD Average Rate**: Month-to-Date interest rate.
- **MoM Variations**: MoM analysis of interest rate variations.

### 5. Average Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio:
